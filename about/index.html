                    <h1>The DSFA Pilot</h1>
                    <p>The pilot introduces students to entry-level jobs in areas like Web Development and Design, Digital Marketing, Game Development, Quality Assurance, Data Management, UX, and more, using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, and other programming languages. 
                    <br><br>    
                    We teach students to understand that computational thinking is essential to the development of computer applications, but can also be used to support problem-solving across all disciplines, including math, science and the humanities.</p>

                    <p>We have selected career pathways that are based on research into job skills most requested by local tech employers. Students can narrow down their field of study to reflect their interests and dive deeper into learning in those areas.</p>

Our priority is to invest in Seattle communities to increase educational and job training opportunities.</p>
