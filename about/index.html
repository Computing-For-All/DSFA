                Our mission is to break down cultural and systemic social
                barriers that prevent youth and young adults of all
                ethnicities, genders, and abilities from exploring computer
                science and technology as potential careers and fields of
                study.

                            computational thinking is essential to the
                            development of computer applications, but can
                            also be used to support problem-solving across
                            all disciplines, including math, science and the
                            humanities.

                            and dive deeper into learning in those areas.
