                <p>My name is Victoria Ulm. I'm a senior at Roosevelt High School. I currently work for Juma while I'm doing an apprentanceship with Computing For All. I rowed for Green Lake Crew for five years and I was in their Varsity woman's boat for 2 years. I have built my own computer and I play video games as a hobby.

I went from Arrowhead Elementary, to Eckstein Middle School, to my current school.</p>
