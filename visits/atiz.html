            <p>
                Atiz gave us a first-hand look at how a business in the fashion

            <h1>Pursuing Our Passion In Fashion</h1>
            <p>
                Four of us from the Digital Skills For All class went on a field trip
                to Atiz Fashion House in Tukwila Washington. As soon as we got there,
                we went inside the Atiz office and got a look at their workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                We meet Swati, founder of Atiz, and she brought us to a lounge area
                where we sat down and shared some of our projects and what we were
                working on. After that, Swati sat down with us and shared some of her
                work and how she designs special clothing for specific cultures. She
                talked about her own website that she and her helper created using
                HTML, CSS, and React. Then, she showed us a video of the other
                manager, Jessica, and she spoke about how social media is a very big
                aspect of showing people your work and your business across the world
                and people can react and give feed back to what was good and bad about
                whatever you're doing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-img-large">
            <img src="images/atiz-gal01.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-copy">
            <p>
                She also video called the creator of the website and he talked to us
                about how learning code and how every industry will always use the
                technology, so it will be so easy to find jobs, and he also explained
                some of the most popular coding programs like CSS and React. At the
                end, Swati wanted us to share and bring people's attention to what we
                are doing in class, so she started an Instagram live video and we each
                talked about what our part is, what we do, and how we are making an
                impact in the world.

                            We want to give a special thank you to Swati Padmaraj for
                            having us over at her office and showing us into the
                            fashion industry and how it's going to be a very big part
                            on our future.
