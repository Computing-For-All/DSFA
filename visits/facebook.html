                    We were introduced to Facebook's approach to finding a career into the
                    tech industry. We were provided tips on resume and job search
                    techniques along with a look into their business culture.

                    Excitement was in the air as students and teachers from our Digital
                    Skills Youth Academy flowed into the underground lobby of Facebook’s
                    Seattle office. After signing in and being given custom guest badges,
                    we were ushered into a private meeting room where we were greeted by a
                    panel of accomplished young software engineers.

                    Each Facebook employee took turns sharing the personal journey they
                    took to land a job at Facebook. It was useful to hear the story of
                    each employee’s distinctly different path. Some fell in love with
                    computer science early in life or were inspired by friends and peers
                    in the field; others couldn’t imagine coding until another passion
                    swept them into the tech world. Everyone emphasized the importance of
                    networking and having a passion for what they did. They all encouraged
                    the students to find that passion within themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The panel offered advice for entering the tech industry, explained
                    what their day- to-day work looks like at Facebook, and fielded
                    questions from the students. Their answers highlighted the importance
                    of self-motivation and engagement in personal projects that showcase
                    interests and know-how. Everyone seemed to agree that practical skills
                    were more valuable to employers than a prestigious educational
                    background.

                    After hearing from boots-on-the-ground members of Facebook's
                    operation, we toured the open-plan office work spaces. Original murals
                    by local artists, thriving plant life, and colorful illustrations
                    adorned the walls of the space. We had a couple of fun photo ops on
                    the balcony overlooking Seattle's skyline, and in a specially curated
                    "anti-gravity room" designed to confuse the Instagram followers of
                    Facebook's visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the tour we were all encouraged to write on a community
                    chalk wall that hosted the drawings and comments of visitors from all
                    over the world. The creative and lively space Facebook has curated for
                    its workers provides inspiration and a sense of comfort and
                    well-being.

                    But our visit was not over yet! After being served complimentary
                    lunches, we were greeted by another panel, this time composed of
                    several of Facebook's awesome human resources recruiters. We learned
                    what recruiters are looking for in a resume, ways to prepare for the
                    infamous tech interview, as well as how we can conduct ourselves in a
                    way that is both authentic and appealing to a potential employer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recruiters then sat at a table with two students each to review their
                    resumes and give them personal feedback. This was so valuable; it
                    helped us each maximize our ability to land the jobs we want. Each
                    table even conducted brief mock interviews so we could practice what
                    we learned. It was a treat to see the recruiter's genuine interest and
                    student's engagement during this personalized help session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lessons and support provided by these recruiters was so kind, and
                    above and beyond our expectations. We left Facebook filled with
                    inspiration and a treasure trove of invaluable information and advice!
                    Thank you to Facebook for the hosting this fun and educational day, it
                    was an experience students won't soon forget.
