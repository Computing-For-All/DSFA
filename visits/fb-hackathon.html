            <p>
                We were selected by Facebook's Educational Team to attend their
                Achievement Summit in Califonia and participate in a two day
                hackathon. We were two of twenty teams of finalists from around the
                United States to attend the conference.

            <p>
                During winter quarter, our teams created two games and a Chat Bot
                during our EFTW "Sprint" to send in to the Facebook Engineer for the
                Week competition. We worked on these projects using the Agile Scrum
                approach to teamwork used by many tech companies and found it to be
                very effective.

                Facebookâ€™s educational team was impressed by our work, and we were
                notified at the beginning of April that one of our teams from both
                last summer and this winter had been honored with an invitation to the
                EFTW Achievement Summit. Both teams were invited to attend the Summit
                at Facebook Headquarters in Menlo Park, California! We were two of
                twenty groups of finalists from around the United States to attend the
                conference.

                We participated in a two day Hackathon where we worked from 7:30 AM to
                7:00 PM in teams of four to create a project. Meals were served on
                site and "Lunch and Learns" featured talks with panels of Facebook
                Engineers with inspiring stories to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Hackathon assignment was to create an educational game with social
                value. Each team worked with a FB mentor as we learned how to plan our
                workload with a timeline, do the necessary research, and to make
                quick, informed team decisions before programming.

                By late Friday afternoon we were ready to "pitch" our game to our
                peers and judges. It was an amazing educational experience and the we
                learned how things are done in the tech world! We came back motivated,
                professional, and ready to aim our educational and career trajectory
                at computer technology.
