                We were provided with the opportunities to explore T-Mobile's latest
                5G technology and device applications supported by wireless
                connectivity.

            <h1>Our Immersion Into 5G Technology</h1>
            <p>
                We were invited to take a tour of T-Mobile's facility and get an
                onsite look into the latest technology they are developing. We were
                taken into their show room and were instantly impressed with the
                amount of technology and devices in the works. We were asked to be
                seated in front of a wall of screens to learn about their newest 5G
                technology.
            </p>

                We were given a presentation from the team about their development in
                5G and the history that got them there. It was fun and informative to
                see the progress from the earliest cell phones to the phones we have
                today. They even passed around one of the first ever made cell phones
                to hold; no way that fit in your front pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
                They explained a bit about how 5G works and how it can be applied to
                our day-to-day lives. Not just how it works with our phones, but how
                it can work to make smart cities and smart homes. Even Bill Nye the
                Science Guy showed up (on recorded video) to explain a bit about how
                the technology works and how it can improve our lives.

                Then, we were treated to a drone demonstration showing the capability
                to control a drone through wireless technology and software programs.
                They explained to us how the drone can be partially operated by a
                person while also being set on a flight path programmed into an touch
                pad app and sent wirelessly through 5G.
            </p>
            <p>
                We got to watch the drone take off and fly through its flight path
                above the building. We also got to watch what the drone was seeing
                through its camera on a screen in the launch area. We were even
                allowed to pick up the drone to see how light it is and how it is
                still able to lift and deliver packages, and maybe even pizzas.

                We were taken on a guided tour of the show room and got to see how 5G
                can be used in the real world. They had what they called a "magic
                mirror" that would scan a store product, like clothing, and the mirror
                would give you information on it. It could even change the color of a
                shirt you were trying on or give you details and sound of a set of
                headphones.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also showed us an app that could be used on a motorcycle that
                would pull up a personal assistant to help you. The assistant could
                give you details on parts, how to fix and replace parts, and could
                even order parts for delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                They had many other things set up to show how technology could be used
                to create smart cities. These were things like showing how many cars
                are parked in a deep under ground lot, let sanitation services know
                when bins needed collecting, and how certain objects can be located
                and displayed on a map.

                After the tour, they turned us loose in the show room to play with
                their gadgets. We got to try out their virtual speed way, played some
                virtual reality sports games, and they even had a virtual
                <span class="nowrap">"whack-a-mole".</span> They also had a virtual
                city on the screen wall so we could learn more about how smart cities
                works with different things, from highways to skyscrapers, and in our
                own homes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We learned a lot from our experience and how new technology is
                continually working to improve our lives. It was inspiring to get to
                look at the tech industry first-hand and how we may find a place to
                pursue our passion for coding and tech.
