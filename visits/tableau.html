            <h1>About Our Visit</h1>
            <p>
                Our visit to Tableau began in a meeting room as exceptional employees
                started their allocution about their interesting work at Tableau. It
                was interesting to hear that their product means so much more than
                just making money, getting customers, and simply getting on with the
                day.

            <h1>RecTech/Digital Skills For All Goes To Tableau</h1>
            <p>
                When we arrived and had the opportunity to hear about the workers, it
                suddenly became more than just a visit, and Tableau became more than
                just a quickly growing company. There was a comforting atmosphere when
                listening to their stories. They werenâ€™t afraid to tell you the truth
                because they know someone in the room could be in the shoes they were
                in, and they genuinely sound like honest people that you can trust!

                While we were at Tableau they told us about how they've donated
                millions, and how their objective is to make people's lives easier
                through their product. They then proceeded to lead us to their
                glorious kitchen and alluring view from the rooftop (we even spotted a
                flamingo boat)!
